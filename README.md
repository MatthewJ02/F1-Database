# Formula 1 Database

This project allows the user to search for Formula 1 drivers filtered by various criteria (Name, Nationality, Championships, Wins, etc.) and displays the list in a table which can be ordered in ascending or descending order of any of those criteria. Once the user has searched for drivers, they can put two of them in a head to head which directly compares career statistics between the drivers.

This project is currently in progress.
